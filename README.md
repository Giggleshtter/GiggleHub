GiggleHub is free, and keyless! so what are you waiting for? its just as easy as pasting this loadstring into your executor, "loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Giggleshtter/GiggleHub/refs/heads/main/main"))();" And hitting that run button!!

                   (GiggleHub supports Swift Executor, wave executor, xeno executor, luna executor, evon executor, and pluto executor so far!!!)
